# Python-RandomPassword-Generator

It generates a random password based on the user's desired length of letters, symbols, and numbers by first defining lists of letters, numbers, and symbols, then iteratively selecting random characters from these lists to form the password, and finally shuffling the generated characters and outputting the resulting password.
